<p class="silver">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The open, non-linear environment allows the
 player to explore and choose how they wish to
 play the game. Although storyline missions are
 necessary to progress through the game and unlock 
 certain cities and content, they are not required as
 the player can complete them at their own leisure. When
 not taking on a storyline mission, the player can freely
 -roam and look around the cities of San Andreas, eat in 
 restaurants, or cause havoc by attacking people and causing
 destruction. Creating havoc can attract unwanted and potentially 
 fatal attention from the authorities. The more chaos caused, the
 stronger the response: police will handle "minor" infractions
 (attacking pedestrians, pointing guns at people, stealing vehicles,
 manslaughter, etc.), whereas SWAT teams, the FBI, and the military 
 respond to higher wanted levels.</p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<p class="silver">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Battles with enemy gangs are prompted whenever
 the player ventures into enemy territory and kills at least three
 gang members. If the player then survives three waves of enemies, the
 territory will be won and fellow gang members will begin wandering the 
 streets of these areas. The more territory owned by the player, the more 
 money that will be generated. Occasionally, the player's territory will come 
 under attack from enemy gangs and defeating them will be necessary to retain 
 these areas. Once all marked territories are claimed from one of the two hostile
 gangs for the protagonist's gang, the opposing gang can no longer attack. The 
 player takes control of all the territories!</p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

 Families street gang, a set of a gang that also includes the initially-
hostile Temple Drive and Seville Boulevard Families. The two main rival 
gangs are the Ballas and Los Santos Vagos, both based out of Los Santos. 
The Varrios Los Aztecas also operate in Los Santos. The main gangs of San
 Fierro are the San Fierro Rifa, led by T-Bone Mendez; the Da Nang Boys, a 
 Vietnamese gang; and the San Fierro Triads, whose leader Wu Zi Mu forms an 
 alliance with Carl. In Las Venturas, the only gangs are the Triads and the 
 Italian Mafia The "Loco Syndicate" appears in the San Fierro mission chain, essentially made up of T-Bone
 Mendez's Rifa gangsters, Mike Toreno and a pimp Jizzy B.The Russian Mafia 
 makes a few small appearances in the storyline.</p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
